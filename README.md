Okay, I did it; this probably broke every *rule or principle* that [htmx](https://htmx.org/) has, and it's hard to defend myselfâ€¦ So why did I do this? **For fun!** Guess what? Coding can be fun, and doing things can be entertaining.

## Backstory

Over the past months [I've heard a lot about htmx](https://twitter.com/htmx_org/status/1748546596541980995) and decided to look at it, and it feels magical. In a sea of complexity and maximalism, something as simple as HTML on... steroids? It sounds like a fantastic new world.

And after that, of course, I had to try it, and it's awesome and a really good experience, but while reading about it, me being a React kind of guy *(outch)* couldn't stop thinking about RSC, and how **strangely enough** in my mind those things could work really well together *(yes, I get scared about my own thoughts sometimes too)*. So guess what?

## Let's try this!

I never actually read about returning components from [React Server Actions](https://react.dev/reference/react/use-server) on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), but it definitely is possible, as someone pointed out on Twitter some months prior *(didn't find the tweet)*, so what's then? What else do we need to do?
